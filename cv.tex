\head{Career History}

\clientwork{August 2014 to the present }{\href{http://www.postoffice.co.uk/}{Post Office}}{Senior Software Engineer}

Partnered with \href{http://www.opencredo.com/}{Open Credo} to deliver a \textbf{financial reconcilliation engine} for the Post Office, as part of their \emph{Common Digital Platform}. The application will reconcile financial transactions across Post Office products and identify transactions that cannot be balanced, and provide a reporting user interface for financial service centre staff to investigate unbalanced transactions.\\

The technology stack was Java, Spring Batch, Spring Integration, Spring MVC, RabbitMQ, REST, Google Guava, MySQL, and Tomcat.\\

\clientwork{January 2014 to July 2014}{\href{http://www.monitise.com/}{Monitise}}{Senior Designer and Developer}

Monitise is a leading specialist in mobile money and hired David to help them deliver their financial technology products focusing on mobile banking, payment, and shopping. David's first task was to join the team creating \href{http://www.yaapshopping.com/}{Yaap Shopping}, a first of its kind venture between a telecoms company (Telef\'onica) and a bank (Santander and Caixa), and develop the instrumental credit card payment user interface and backend.\\

David worked closely with other developers to drive up code quality by introducing immutability into the domain, the builder pattern to simplify code and eliminate duplication, and Spring MockMvc for improved unit testing. The technology stack was Java, Spring, JPA/Hibernate, SOAP, REST, Google Guava, and Oracle.\\

Next David evaluated metrics monitoring solutions for Monitise to deploy across all their platforms. During evaluation David integrated Netflix Servo as an OSGi service in the JBoss Fuse ESB, and that proof-of-concept system was ultimately selected as the metrics solution. All evaluations were thoroughly documented on the corporate wiki so other developers could understand the selection rationale and learn how Netflix Servo met Monitise's business and technical requirements.\\

\clientwork{June 2012 to December 2013}{\href{http://www.aimia.com/}{Aimia}}{Senior Designer and Developer}

\renewals{18 months}{2 renewals}

Aimia (formerly Groupe Aeroplan, formerly Loyalty Management Group) is a global leader of loyalty management and owner of the \href{http://www.nectar.com/}{Nectar} brand of loyalty cards. They required senior java developers to engineer a \href{http://www.aimia.com/English/Services/Aimia-Systems/Loyalty-Platform}{flexible and compelling loyalty platform} to allow Aimia to \textbf{win new business}.\\

The development methodology was agile and scrum with some pair-programming.  The technology stack was Java 7, Spring 3, MySQL, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and Camel, while the architecture was a set of independent services deployed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and communicating by REST and JMS. Within this environment David spearheaded the adoption of TDD, BDD, and the use of Cucumber, Hamcrest and Guava to improve development practices and \textbf{drive up code quality}.\\

David designed and developed the Event Hub, a fast, reliable, and robust event raising and collection framework using Camel and Mongo. The Event Hub became a key system component when the Aimia Loyalty Platform was re-engineered to an \textbf{event-driven architecture}.\\

David engineered a star-schema data mart which was populated by the Event Hub in realtime. This provided up-to-the-minute business reports for currency accrual/redemption/expiry, and member enrolment demographics. Visualisation of the reports was by the Pentaho BI Server.\\

Spring Security and OAuth secure the services, and David integrated new security functionality to allow members to login to the web frontend using their Facebook credentials.\\

To satisfy bulk file-handling requirements David used Spring Batch and Mongo to develop a batch processing application supporting both inbound and outbound jobs.\\

The Aimia Loyalty Platform has since \textbf{beaten the competition} to become the loyalty platform for a leading car rental company.\\

\clientwork{February 2011 to May 2012}{\href{http://corp.bankofamerica.com/}{Bank of America Merrill Lynch}}{Senior Designer and Developer}

\renewals{15 months}{3 renewals}

%http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-adds-physical-cash-concentration-to-global-liquidity-platform-2012-03-19

David partnered with ThoughtWorks to deliver GLPv4, a re-write of BAML's \textbf{Global Liquidity Platform}. BAML believed a brand new platform was necessary to provide a solid foundation for rapidly developing novel market-leading \textbf{sweeping} and \textbf{pooling} products, which include \emph{Multi-Currency Notional Pooling}, \emph{Single Currency Notional Pooling}, and \emph{\href{http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-adds-physical-cash-concentration-to-global-liquidity-platform-2012-03-19}{Physical Cash Concentration}}.\\

David worked closely with the main stakeholders and business analysts to develop the master story list, which involved discussing technical issues with non-technical staff, and using his technical experience to estimate story points. David also worked closely with the testing team to develop BDD JBehave stories that would demonstrate in non-technical business language that the liquidity platform had met its business requirements.\\

Development used agile and scrum processes including several months of pair-programming. To develop GLPv4, David leveraged Java, Spring, Oracle, WebSphere MQ and REST to provide a set of compartmentalized fault-tolerant service domains communicating via JMS messaging and HTTP RESTful calls. Within domains database consistency is maintained by JTA and XA, while between domains eventual consistency is ensured by idempotency and compensating transactions.\\

David has gained knowledge of the liquidity problem space and Treasury concerns. He has broadened his practical experience of fault-tolerant, highly parallel messaging systems.\\

\clientwork{October 2006 to January 2011}{\href{http://www.rdfgroup.com/}{RDF Group}}{Lead Practioner}

RDF Group is a supplier of IT solutions and staff and provided David's expertise to Kiln Group, Aimia, and Northern Rock.\\

\clientwork{18 months}{\href{http://www.aimia.com/}{Aimia}}{Senior Developer, Technical Architect}

Aimia required a senior Java developer to enhance their \href{http://www.aimia.com/English/Services/Loyalty-Analytics/default.aspx}{loyalty analytics platform}, SelfServe, and a technical architect to provide guidance and oversight for their diverse array of projects. SelfServe reduces report processing time by a factor of \textbf{60}---manually produced reports that would run in \textbf{5 hours} are now automated and run in less than \textbf{5 minutes}.\\

David was comissioned to replace a problematic JavaScript-based SQL templating system, whose brittleness, inflexibity and untestability was endangering project deadlines, of which failure to meet would result in stiff contractual penalties. David worked closely with data analysts to understand how a SQL templating system would have to integrate with their reports, and then developed a fast, flexible, and testable Java SQL templating engine which was easy to develop reports for. David then provided training sessions for the offshore development team so they were able to take over and provide ongoing support. Thanks to the new SQL templating system, \textbf{deadlines were met} and \textbf{financial penalties avoided}. \\

Aimia wanted to better leverage the analytics gathered from mailshots and other product promotion strategies, so that customers could gain insight into their promotional efforts. David was asked to lead the design and development of a \emph{Campaign Analysis Platform}, using Java, Wicket, and SQL and integrating with SelfServe.\\

Aimia were eagerly pursuing new loyalty data analytics markets and wanted to better understand how to repurpose their UK-focussed SelfServe platform to be deployable in international markets. David combined his extensive knowledge of SelfServe with input from key stakeholders and insight from data analysts to author a series of high-level technical steering documents advising how to generalize the database ``star-schema'', support internationalization, and simplify deployment and runtime configuration. From this foundation, Aimia was able to successfully adapt SelfServe and \textbf{won new business} in several international markets, including Italy and Australia.\\

David then joined a team of three technical architects to provide architectural oversight for new projects, and to simplify application management and development by streamlining their build infrastructure. David worked with other architects, managers, team leads, and data analysts to provide a broad range of technical advice and insight.\\

\clientwork{9 months}{\href{http://kilngroup.com/}{Kiln Group}}{Lead Designer and Developer}

Enhanced a bespoke marine insurance and reinsurance application (Java, Oracle, Swing, and EJB) to support underwriting of aviation and space business, which will earn an estimated \textsterling27 million per year in premiums. A second project enhanced Pyrites to support the German insurance market and is expected to grow  Kiln's insurance portfolio by \textsterling18 million.\\

\clientwork{30 months}{\href{http://www.northernrock.co.uk}{Northern Rock}}{Designer and Developer}

Extended and maintained the online customer mortgage Java EJB2 application. Worked with analysts to refine requirements and with quality assurance testers to ensure correctness of implementation.\\

\jobheld{July 2000 to July 2006}{C Squared Consulting}

For the California Department of Justice, David provided the necessary skills to develop a fault tolerant and high performance message switch written in C, BEA Tuxedo, and Oracle, which integrated the \href{http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/clets/}{California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System} with state and federal systems.\\

Led a team of two C and Oracle developers to create a public website for California's \href{http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/31/MN5478.DTL}{Do Not Call} legislation that mandated a registry of names and phone numbers that telemarketers cannot contact.\\

Created \emph{XCourt}, a .NET solution to automate California's manual court disposition process.\\
