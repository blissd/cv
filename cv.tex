\head{Career History}

\clientwork{November 2014 to present day}{\href{https://www.hivehome.com}{Centrica Hive}}{Big Data Engineer}

\renewals{5}

British Gas Connected Homes collects a tremendous amount of data from smart meters, which can submit a reading every 30, and desired developing a data platform to analyse this data and provide valuable insight to their customers to retain a lead in Britain’s competitive energy market. Data science is applied to produce personalized energy breakdowns so customers can understand their own energy usage under the British Gas “My Energy” product.\\

David joined the British Gas Connected Homes data platform team to productionize data science algorithms. The primary task is working with data engineers to understand algorithms created by data scientists and to implement them in Scala to run on an analytics cluster built on Spark, and Cassandra.\\

Productionizing involves understanding the data required by an algorithm so it may be modelled appropriately in the Cassandra database, developing Spark pipelines to parallelize processing, and implementing algorithms using machine learning libraries such as Weka and techniques such as random forests.\\

Other tasks included developing a data bulk loading tool for importing tremendous amounts of data into Cassandra after standard tools for the task proved inadequate, versioning algorithm outputs within Cassandra, designing the means for importing ten times the data into the data platform for the next set of deliverables, and automating the execution of data science processing jobs.\\

Scala, Spark, Kafka, Cassandra, Python, Java, Spring, and REST.\\

\clientwork{August 2014 to November 2014 }{\href{http://www.postoffice.co.uk/}{Post Office}}{Developer}
