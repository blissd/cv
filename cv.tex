\head{Career History}

\clientwork{February 2011 to May 2012}{\href{http://corp.bankofamerica.com/}{Bank of America Merrill Lynch}}{Senior Designer and Developer}

\renewals{15 months}{3 renewals}

%http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-adds-physical-cash-concentration-to-global-liquidity-platform-2012-03-19

David partnered with ThoughtWorks to deliver GLPv4, a re-write of BAML's \textbf{Global Liquidity Platform}. BAML believed a brand new platform was necessary to provide a solid foundation for rapidly developing novel market-leading \textbf{sweeping} and \textbf{pooling} products, which include \emph{Multi-Currency Notional Pooling}, \emph{Single Currency Notional Pooling}, and \emph{\href{http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-adds-physical-cash-concentration-to-global-liquidity-platform-2012-03-19}{Physical Cash Concentration}}.\\

David worked closely with the main stakeholders and business analysts to develop the master story list, which involved discussing technical issues with non-technical staff, and using his technical experience to estimate story points. David also worked closely with the testing team to develop BDD JBehave stories that would demonstrate in non-technical business language that the liquidity platform had met its business requirements.\\

Development used agile and scrum processes and involved several months of pair-programming. To develop GLPv4, David leveraged Java, Spring, Oracle, WebSphere MQ and REST to provide a set of compartmentalized fault-tolerant service domains communicating via JMS messaging and HTTP RESTful calls. Within domains database consistency is maintained by JTA and XA, while between domains eventual consistency is ensured by idempotency and compensating transactions.\\

David has gained knowledge of the liquidity problem space and Treasury concerns. He has broadened his practical experience of fault-tolerant, highly parallel messaging systems.\\

\clientwork{October 2006 to January 2011}{\href{http://www.rdfgroup.com/}{RDF Group}}{Lead Practioner}

RDF Group is a supplier of IT solutions and staff and provided David's expertise to Kiln Group, Aimia, and Northern Rock.\\

\clientwork{18 months}{\href{http://www.aimia.com/}{Aimia}}{Senior Developer, Technical Architect}

Aimia (formerly Groupe Aeroplan, formerly Loyalty Management Group), is a global leader of loyalty management and owner of the \href{http://www.nectar.com/}{Nectar} brand of loyalty cards. They required a senior Java developer to enhance their \href{http://www.aimia.com/English/Services/Loyalty-Analytics/default.aspx}{loyalty analytics platform}, SelfServe, and a technical architect to provide guidance and oversight for their diverse array of projects. SelfServe reduces report processing time by a factor of \textbf{60}---manually produced reports that would run in \textbf{5 hours} are now automated and run in less than \textbf{5 minutes}.\\

David was comissioned to replace a problematic JavaScript-based SQL templating system, whose brittleness, inflexibity and untestability was endangering project deadlines, of which failure to meet would result in stiff contractual penalties. David worked closely with data analysts to understand how a SQL templating system would have to integrate with their reports, and then developed a fast, flexible, and testable Java SQL templating engine which was easy to develop reports for. David then provided training sessions for the offshore development team so they were able to take over and provide ongoing support. Thanks to the new SQL templating system, \textbf{deadlines were met} and \textbf{financial penalties avoided}. \\

Aimia wanted to better leverage the analytics gathered from mailshots and other product promotion strategies, so that customers could gain insight into their promotional efforts. David was asked to lead the design and development of a \emph{Campaign Analysis Platform}, using Java, Wicket, and SQL and integrating with SelfServe.\\

Aimia were eagerly pursuing new loyalty data analytics markets and wanted to better understand how to repurpose their UK-focussed SelfServe platform to be deployable in international markets. David combined his extensive knowledge of SelfServe with input from key stakeholders and insight from data analysts to author a series of high-level technical steering documents advising how to generalize the database ``star-schema'', support internationalization, and simplify deployment and runtime configuration. From this foundation, Aimia was able to successfully adapt SelfServe and \textbf{won new business} in several international markets, including Italy and Australia.\\

David then joined a team of three technical architects to provide architectural oversight for new projects, and to simplify application management and development by streamlining their build infrastructure. David worked with other architects, managers, team leads, and data analysts to provide a broad range of technical advice and insight.\\

\clientwork{9 months}{\href{http://kilngroup.com/}{Kiln Group}}{Lead Designer and Developer}

Enhanced a bespoke marine insurance and reinsurance application (Java, Oracle, Swing, and EJB) to support underwriting of aviation and space business, which will earn an estimated \textsterling27 million per year in premiums. A second project enhanced Pyrites to support the German insurance market and is expected to grow  Kiln's insurance portfolio by \textsterling18 million.\\

\clientwork{30 months}{\href{http://www.northernrock.co.uk}{Northern Rock}}{Designer and Developer}

Extended and maintained the online customer mortgage Java EJB2 application. Worked with analysts to refine requirements and with quality assurance testers to ensure correctness of implementation.\\

\jobheld{July 2000 to July 2006}{C Squared Consulting}

For the California Department of Justice, David provided the necessary skills to develop a fault tolerant and high performance message switch written in C, BEA Tuxedo, and Oracle, which integrated the \href{http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/clets/}{California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System} with state and federal systems.\\

Led a team of two C and Oracle developers to create a public website for California's \href{http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/31/MN5478.DTL}{Do Not Call} legislation that mandated a registry of names and phone numbers that telemarketers cannot contact.\\

Created \emph{XCourt}, a .NET solution to automate California's manual court disposition process.\\
