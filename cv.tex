\head{Professional Experience}

\jobheld{Yottabyte Limited}{January 2011 to the present}

%\clientwork{Bank of America}{February 2011 to May 2012}

\begin{itemize}

\item Joined a team of 15 developers desiging and developing the next generation of Bank of America's award winning and market-leading Global Liquidity Platform. Worked in an agile environment with daily stand ups, pair programming, and retrospectives.

\end{itemize}

\jobheld{RDF Group}{October 2006 to January 2011}

RDF Group, a leading supplier of IT solutions to blue chip customers across the UK, recruited me to gain my proven technical knowledge and experience.

%\clientwork{Kiln Group}{9 months}

\begin{itemize}

\item Enhanced \emph{Pyrites}, a marine insurance application, to support underwriting of aviation and space business, which will earn an estimated \textsterling27 million per year in insurance premiums for \href{http://www.kilngroup.com/}{Kiln Group}, one of Europe's leading reinsurance and insurance underwriters trading in the Lloyds market. A second Kiln project enhanced Pyrites to support the German insurance market and is expected to grow  Kiln's insurance portfolio by \textsterling18 million.

\end{itemize}

%\clientwork{Loyalty Management Group (aka Groupe Aeroplan)}{12 months}

\begin{itemize}

\item Joined a team of three technical architects at \href{http://www.aimia.com/}{Aimia}, a global leader of customer loyalty management and owner of the \emph{Nectar} brand of loyalty cards.  Comissioned to provide architectual oversight for new projects, and to simplify application management and development by upgrading their build infrastructure to Maven, JIRA, Bamboo, and Sonatype Nexus.

\item Authored a series of high-level technical documents for Amia to provide technical steering for extending their loyalty analytics products for internationalization, simplifying deployment and runtime configuration, and supporting international variants of the ``star-schema'' retail data model.  

\item Led the design and development of Aimia's \emph{Campaign Analysis Platform}, a rich web interface with a database backend for a concurrent report queueing system used to analyze Nectar customer data.

\item Engineered an SQL templating system for \emph{SelfServe}, an Java EJB3 and SQL data analysis application, allowing the Aimia to rapidly create SQL reports to run against a 10TB data warehouse.  Processing time was reduced by a factor of \textbf{60}---manually produced reports that would run in \textbf{5 hours} are now automated and run in less than \textbf{5 minutes}.

\end{itemize}

%\clientwork{Northern Rock}{24 months}

\begin{itemize}

\item Extended and maintained the online customer mortgage Java EJB2 application for \href{http://www.northernrock.co.uk}{Northern Rock}, one of England's leading mortgage providers.

\end{itemize}

%\clientwork{Internal RDF projects}{}

\begin{itemize}

\item Mentored two junior Java developers.

\end{itemize}

\jobheld{C Squared Consulting}{July 2000 to July 2006}

C Squared Consulting specializes in providing software services to California's law enforcement agencies.  For six years I worked with various software stacks on systems ranging from small internally used web applications, politically-charged web sites, and large high-performance message switches.

\begin{itemize}

\item Developed a reliable, fault tolerant, parallel, high performance, message switch to integrate the \href{http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/clets/}{California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System} with statewide and nationwide systems to provide California and the other 49 US states with reciprocal access to each others' criminal intelligence databases.  The system integrates the FBI's National Crime Information Center, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, and California's Department of Motor Vehicles, and processes in excess of 1,400,000 messages per day.  This is a safety-critical application that police officers' lives depend on.  \emph{Key technologies: C, BEA Tuxedo, C, TCP/IP sockets, UNIX}.

\item Led a team of two developers to create a web-based solution for California's \emph{Do Not Call} legislation that mandated a registry of names and phone numbers that telemarketers cannot contact.  The Do Not Call registry was \href{http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/31/MN5478.DTL}{eagerly anticipated by California's residents} and over two million Californians registered during the system's lifetime.

\item Designed and developed \emph{XCourt}, a .NET and MSSQL web-based solution for California's manual court disposition process. The solution is used by 58 counties in California and has successfully reduced the disposition processing time from \emph{60 days} to only \emph{12 hours}.

\item Performance tested the California Department of Justice's \href{http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/}{Megan's Law} website.

\item Engineered a Java TCP/IP computer interface between California's Statewide Intelligence Network System and the Department of Justice's criminal intelligence databases.

\item Developed \emph{LEAWEB}, a web-based application written in C with a C-ISAM database to replace antiquated teletype terminals accessing the Department of Justice's criminal databases.  The value of my work was acknowledged by an award presented by the California Attorney General.

\end{itemize}

\head{Education}

\jobheld{University of Brighton}{1994 to 2000}

BSc (with Honours) Computer Science (2:1), which included one year's work experience at the California Department of Justice to develop and support a web-based messaging system. 

Higher National Diploma in Software Engineering.
