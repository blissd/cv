\head{Professional Experience}

\jobheld{RDF Group}{October 2006 to the present}

RDF Group, a leading supplier of IT solutions to blue chip customers across the UK, recruited me to gain my proven technical knowledge and experience.  Since being promoted in 2009 to \emph{Lead Practitioner}, I have been placed onsite with various clients to provide services of technical insight and product development.

%\clientwork{Kiln Group}{9 months}

\begin{itemize}

\item Revitalized \emph{Pyrites}, a marine insurance application, to support underwriting of aviation and space business, which will earn \textsterling27 million per year in insurance premiums for \href{http://www.kilngroup.com/}{Kiln Group}, one of Europe's leading reinsurance and large commercial insurance underwriters trading in the Lloyds market.  A second Kiln project enhanced Pyrites to support the German RLC insurance market and is expected to grow  Kiln's insurance portfolio by \textsterling18 million.  \emph{Key technologies: Java, EJB2, Swing, Web Start, SQL, Oracle, JBoss 4, Ant.}

\item Led the design and development of the \emph{Campaign Analysis Platform}, a rich web interface for a concurrent report queueing system used by the \href{http://www.loyalty.co.uk/}{Loyalty Management Group}, England's leading loyalty card management company and owner of the \emph{Nectar} brand of loyalty cards.  \emph{Key technologies: Java, EJB3, JPA, Wicket, SQL, Oracle, Kognitio WX2 data warehouse, JBoss 5, Maven.}

\end{itemize}

%\clientwork{Loyalty Management Group (aka Groupe Aeroplan)}{12 months}

\begin{itemize}

\item Authored a series of high-level technical documents for the Loyalty Management Group to provide technical steering for extending their software products for internationalization, simplifying deployment and runtime configuration, and supporting international variants of the ``star-schema'' retail data model.

\item Engineered an SQL templating system for \emph{SelfServe}, an EPOS data analysis application, allowing the Loyalty Management Group to rapidly create SQL reports to run against a 10TB WX2 data warehouse.  Running reports against WX2 has \href{http://www.kognitio.com/casestudies/casestudy_lmg.php}{reduced processing time by a factor of \textbf{60}}---manually produced reports that would run in \textbf{5 hours} are now automated and run in less than \textbf{5 minutes}.  \emph{Key technologies: Java, JEE, StringTemplate, SQL, Oracle, WX2 data warehouse, JBoss 5, Maven.}

\end{itemize}

%\clientwork{Northern Rock}{24 months}

\begin{itemize}

\item Extended and maintained a web-based ecommerce application for \href{http://www.northernrock.co.uk}{Northern Rock}, one of England's leading mortgage providers.  \emph{Key technologies: Java, EJB2, iBatis, JMS, XSLT, IBM WebLogic, Ant.}

\item Assumed the task of improving development processes internal to RDF. Introduced the Hudson continuous integration server, authored templates for quickly creating new Maven projects, installed a SonaType Nexus artifact repository, and spearheaded using Bugzilla and Mylyn for tracking tasks.  I also gave a series of presentations on tools and libraries to improve development; such as the Joda-Time date/time library, the Maven build tool, Mylyn/Bugzilla,  and the Mockito mocking library. 

\end{itemize}

%\clientwork{Internal RDF projects}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed an employee review system used internally for RDF's performance review process.  \emph{Key technologies: Java, the Spring Framework, MySQL, Wicket, Maven, Tomcat.}

\item Mentored two junior Java developers.

\end{itemize}

\jobheld{C Squared Consulting}{July 2000 to July 2006}

C Squared Consulting specializes in providing software services to law enforcement agencies.  For six years I worked with various software stacks on systems ranging from small internally used web applications, politically-charged publically accessible web sites, and large high-performance message switches.

\begin{itemize}

\item Developed a reliable, fault tolerant, parallel, high performance, message switch to integrate the \href{http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/clets/}{California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System} with statewide and nationwide systems to provide California and the other 49 US states with reciprocal access to each others' criminal intelligence databases.  The system integrates the FBI's National Crime Information Center, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, and California's Department of Motor Vehicles, and processes in excess of 1,400,000 messages per day.  This is a safety-critical application that police officers' lives depend on.  \emph{Key technologies: C, BEA Tuxedo, C, TCP/IP sockets}.

\item Led a team of two developers to create a web-based solution for California's \emph{Do Not Call} legislation that mandated a registry of names and phone numbers that telemarketers cannot contact.  The Do Not Call registry was \href{http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/31/MN5478.DTL}{eagerly anticipated by California's residents} and over two million Californians registered during the system's lifetime.  \emph{Key technologies: C, Oracle, CGI, XML, Apache, POSIX message queues, UNIX signals.}

\item Designed and developed \emph{XCourt}, a web-based solution for California's manual court disposition process. The solution is used by 58 counties in California and has successfully reduced the disposition processing time from \emph{60 days} to only \emph{12 hours}. \emph{Key technologies: C\#, IIS, MSMQ, SQL Server, BizTalk Server, XML, XSLT.}

\item Performance tested the California Department of Justice's \href{http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/}{Megan's Law} website.

\item Engineered a TCP/IP computer interface between California's Statewide Intelligence Network System and the Department of Justice's criminal databases. \emph{Key technologies: Java, EJB2, Oracle, OC4J, Oracle AQ, TCP/IP }

\item Supported and extended \emph{LEAWEB}, a web-based application to replace antiquated teletype terminals accessing the Department of Justice's criminal databases.  The value of my work was acknowledged by an award presented by the California Attorney General. \emph{Key technologies: C, C-ISAM database, CGI, TCP/IP, System V IPC, POSIX message queues, UNIX signals, C-ISAM database.}

\end{itemize}
