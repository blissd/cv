        location: London
        summary: Helping people move forward with credit.
        highlights:
          - Design and implementation of a new data streaming platform built in Confluent Cloud and Snowflake. Designed a DBT project for creating and managing data models. Designed and implemented encryption-at-rest for Apache Kafka by integrating with the HashiCorp Vault Transit Security Engine.
          - Integrated applications into NewDay's observability platform using an Open Telemetry collector deployed to Kubernetes by ArgoCD with metrics and alerts in NewRelic managed by Crossplane.
          # Following entries are from first stint at NewDay.
          - Developed Golang tooling for scrubbing and importing 24 terabytes of CSV data into AWS Athena, allowing NewDay to migrate away from a third-party service and reduce costs by £1.4 million per year.
          - Solved a batch system's AWS S3 "small files problem" which would turn a 40GB input file into 80,000 very small Parquet files being written to S3. The file processing was redesigned to write to S3 a small number of large Parquet files. File processing time was reduced by two hours allowing NewDay to meet SLAs and storage space was reduced by 10 times.
          - Designed and implemented an AWS lambda to refresh views in the Dremio data lake engine. The solution reduced processing time and costs for updating database views and centralised view configuration into a single location per environment, which gave data engineers and analysts a complete overview of an environment's view requirements.
          - Designed and implemented a Scala FS2 batch job to process large JSON files and convert to Parquet tables.
          - Wrote a Golang utility for quickly deleting records from AWS DynamoDB.

      - company: "[11:FS Foundry](https://www.11fs.com)"
        position: Scala Microservice Engineer

        end_date: 2020-02
        location: London
        summary: FinTech consultants building digital financial services.
        highlights:
          - Designed and developed micro-services to support Foundry, a ledger-first API driven banking platform. The platform was built using the Lightbend Lagom micro-services framework, Scala, Cassandra, and Kafka.
          - Designed and implemented the micro-services to support the expiry of payment card authorisations. The functionality was delivered over two sprints to support the alpha release of a new payment card product.
          - Led the adoption of the Apache Avro message format for Kafka messages to improve performance and reduce the risk of breaking changes to message formats.

      - company: "[Hive](https://www.hivehome.com/)"

        location: London
        summary: Provider of smart-thermostats and IoT devices.
        highlights:
          - Designed and developed pipelines with Kafka, Kafka Streams, and Apache Spark to implement data science algorithms to deliver customer-facing products derived from Hive thermostat data. Algorithms were packaged as Docker images and deployed with Helm charts to a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS. Processes at a rate of 100,000+ messages per second.
          - Worked with data scientists to deliver a Kafka Streams application to analyse thermostat state, detect when a customer's heating fails, and notify the customer of that failure. A batch-based Python prototype algorithm was delivered by data scientists, but was unsuitable for real-time failure detection, so I redesigned the algorithm to work as a real-time Kafka Streams application.
          - Designed and developed a data pipeline to feed smart meter readings into algorithms to deliver energy usage insights to British Gas customers. Applied a random forest, from the Weka machine learning library, to classify customer energy usage.
          - Developed a processing pipeline tool to convert IoT device protobuf messages from an AWS kinesis stream to daily aggregated Parquet files stored in S3 and queryable from Athena.
