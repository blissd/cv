## 🧑‍💻 Experience

### Data Engineer at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/) — _July 2022 to present_

Involved with the design and implementation of a new data streaming platform built in Confluent Cloud and Snowflake. Designed DBT project for creating and managing data models. 

_Kafka, Terraform, Terragrunt, DBT, Confluent Cloud, Snowflake._

### Scala/Python/Golang Data Engineer at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/) — _April 2020 to October 2021_

Developed Golang tooling for scrubbing and importing 24 terabytes of CSV data into AWS Athena, allowing NewDay to migrate away from a third-party service and reduce costs by __£1.4 million per year__.

Solved a Scala Akka Actor batch processing system's AWS S3 "small files problem". Before designing and implementing a solution a 40GB input file would result in 80,000 very small Parquet files being written to S3, after the changes a small number of large Parquet files were written to S3. This __reduced__ file processing time __by two hours__ allowing NewDay to meet SLAs, removed the need for a time-consuming file consolidation process, reduced storage space by 10 times, and reduced processing costs.

Designed and implemented an AWS lambda to refresh views in the Dremio data lake engine. The solution __reduced processing time and costs__ for updating views and centralised view configuration into a single location per environment, which gave data engineers a complete overview of an environment's view requirements.

Designed and implemented a Scala FS2 batch job to process large JSON files and convert to Parquet tables.
Wrote a Golang utility for quickly deleting records from AWS DynamoDB.

_Scala, Python, Golang, FS2, AWS Batch, AWS Lambda, Dremio._

### Scala Microservice Engineer at [11:FS Foundry](https://www.11fs.com) — _August 2019 to February 2020_

Designed and developed microservices to support Foundry, a ledger-first API driven banking platform. The platform was built using the Lightbend Lagom microservices framework, Scala, Cassandra, and Kafka.

Designed and implemented the microservices to support the expiry of payment card authorisations. The functionality was delivered over two sprints to support the alpha release of a new payment card product.

Led the adoption of the Apache Avro message format for Kafka messages to improve performance and reduce the risk of breaking changes to message formats.

_AWS, GCP, Micro-services, Scala, Kubernetes, Kafka, Cassandra, Docker, Helm, Lagom, Avro._

### Big Data Engineer at [Hive](https://www.hivehome.com/) — _November 2014 to July 2019_

Designed and developed pipelines with Kafka, Kakfa Streams, and Apache Spark, to implement data science algorithms to deliver customer-facing products derived from Hive thermostat data. Algorithms were packaged as Docker images and deployed with Helm charts to a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS. Processes at a rate of __100,000+__ messages per second.

Worked with data scientists to deliver a Kafka Streams application to analyse thermostat state, detect when a customer's heating fails, and notify the customer of that failure. A batch-based Python prototype algorithm was delivered by data scientists, but was unsuitable for real-time failure detection, so I redesigned the algorithm to work as a __real-time Kafka Streams__ application.

Designed and developed a data pipeline to feed smart meter readings into algorithms to deliver energy usage insights to British Gas customers. Applied a __random forest__, from the Weka machine learning library, to classify customer energy usage.

Developed a processing pipeline tool to convert IoT device __protobuf__ messages from an AWS kinesis stream to daily aggregated Parquet files stored in S3 and queryable from Athena.

_AWS, Scala, Spark, Kafka, Kafka Streams, Cassandra, Python, Kubernetes, Helm, Docker._

### Java Developer at [Post Office](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/) — _August 2014 to November 2014_

Delivered a financial reconciliation engine to reconcile financial transactions across Post Office products, identify transactions that cannot be balanced, and provide a reporting user interface for financial service centre staff to investigate unbalanced transactions.

_Java, Spring Batch, Spring Integration, Spring MVC, RabbitMQ, REST, MySQL, and Tomcat._

### Java Developer at [Monitise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitise) — _January 2014 to July 2014_

Developed the credit card payment user interface and backend for Yaap Shopping, a first of its kind venture between a telecoms company (Telefónica) and a bank (Santander and Caixa). Evaluated metrics monitoring solutions for Monitise to deploy across all their platforms.

### Java Developer at [Aimia](https://www.aimia.com/) — _June 2012 to December 2013_

Aimia is a global leader of loyalty management and owner of the Nectar brand of loyalty cards. Delivered a flexible and compelling loyalty platform to allow Aimia to win new business. Developed a batch processing framework (Spring Batch, Mongo DB) for ingesting large files from third-party suppliers. Introduced property-based testing and BDD to drive up code quality.

_Java, Spring, Spring Batch, Mongo DB, MySQL, Apache Camel, Rabbit MQ, AWS, REST, asynchronous events, pair programming._

### Java Microservice Developer at [Bank of America Merrill Lynch](https://www.bankofamerica.com/) — _February 2011 to May 2012_

Delivered a Global Liquidity Platform that became a solid foundation for rapidly developing novel market- leading sweeping and pooling products, which included Multi-Currency Notional Pooling, Single Currency Notional Pooling, and Physical Cash Concentration.

_Java, Spring, Hibernate, idempotency, compensating transactions, parallelism, pair programming._

### Java Lead Practitioner at [RDF Group](https://www.rdfgroup.com/) — _October 2006 to January 2011_

RDF Group is a supplier of IT solutions and staff and provided my expertise to the loyalty systems company Aimia, the marine insurance and reinsurance provider Kiln Group, and the bank Northern Rock.

### C/C#/Java Developer at C Squared Consulting — _July 2000 to July 2006_

Developed a fault-tolerant and high-performance message switch (C, BEA Tuxedo, and Oracle), which integrated the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System with state and federal systems.

Lead development of California's "Do Not Call" system.
